# Marvin
Essentials for Marvin LoRa Development

## Getting started

### Install Arduino IDE

Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and follow the installer. 

If you want to donate to Arduino -to help developing their software we are thankfully using- this is possible, but not mandatory.

### Install MarvinLib

Copy the folder MarvinLib to sketchbook/libraries/
The sketchbook folder can be found in the Arduino IDE under file->preferences->Sketchbook location:

### Connect Marvin to computer

Use your left or right (or a combination) hand to push the Marvin in the USB port of your computer. Your computer will quickly befriend it and say "blingBLING", which is computer language for "we are now BFFs!".

### Upload Blinky

Download (or copy-paste the contents of) [Blinky.ino](https://github.com/iotacademy/marvin/blob/master/Software/MarvinBlink/MarvinBlink.ino) and open it in the Arduino IDE.

From the 'Tools' menu select 'Arduino Leonardo' in the 'Boards' section.

Click upload to send the software to the Marvin. If all went well it will say Uploading complete and the second LED will blink, if not try uploading again.

### Check RN2483

Download [MarvinMultiSerial.ino](https://github.com/iotacademy/marvin/blob/master/Software/MarvinMultiSerial/MarvinMultiSerial.ino) and open it in the Arduino IDE.

Upload it to the Marvin and then open the Serial Monitor

![Serial Monitor](https://raw.github.com/iotacademy/marvin/master/Software/Pictures/Serial.jpg)

Set the baudrate to 57600 (same as in the sketch) and select 'CR+NL'. Now you can directly speak to the RN2483 and get a response.

If you for instance send 'sys get ver', the module will return its firmware version back. This will be 1.0.1 with some historic date.

Possible other commands can be find in the module [data sheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/40001784E.pdf) or in [one of the many](https://www.disk91.com/2015/technology/networks/first-step-in-lora-land-microchip-rn2483-test/) [examples](https://thinginnovations.uk/getting-started-with-microchip-rn2483-lorawan-modules) [by others](http://kotahi.net/configure-microchip-rn2483-module/).

## Using your first sensor

The Marvin uses Grove sensors. Grove is a standard developed by [Seeedstudio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/category/Grove-c-45.html), a large electronics shop. In their [wiki page](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Main_Page) you can find a quite comprehensive collection of documentation of all products.

### Sensor and connector

The pinout of the Marvin allows for 3 analog sensors, 1 digital and 1 I2C sensor (I2C can also be used as regular digital port). If needed, with a splitter up to 256 I2C can be hooked up though.

## Sending message to other Marvin

Upload MarvinMultiSerial to two Marvins

### Listening

On the first Marvin, open serial monitor and type:
```
mac pause 
radio rx 0
```
This will put it in continous listening mode. If it says 'radio_err' it is timed out or received something weird. No worries, just repeat 'radio rx 0' command to restart it.

### Broadcasting

On the second Marvin type:
```
mac pause
radio set pwr 14
radio tx 12345678
```
On the serial monitor of Marvin 1 it should display your message '12345678'.
